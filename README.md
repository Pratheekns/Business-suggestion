# 📊 Understanding Customer Sentiment for Profitable Tourist-Focused Restaurant Investment  

## 🏆 Objective  
In highly competitive, tourist-driven dining markets, attracting and retaining customers is crucial. This project leverages Yelp review data from 14 tourist-heavy cities to analyze customer sentiment and identify key success factors for restaurant profitability.  

By understanding what diners love, what drives them away, and how business attributes impact sentiment, we aim to provide **data-driven insights for restaurant investors** looking to optimize pricing strategies, menu offerings, and location choices.  

## 📍 Cities Analyzed  
Philadelphia, Nashville, Tampa, New Orleans, Santa Barbara, Reno, Virginia City, Saint Petersburg, Clearwater, Treasure Island, St. Pete Beach, Boise, Vail, and Oro Valley.  

## 🔍 Key Research Questions  
- How does review sentiment correlate with restaurant star ratings in tourist-heavy areas?  
- What business attributes (e.g., outdoor seating, free WiFi, alcohol service) contribute most to positive sentiment?  
- Do operating hours impact customer sentiment?  
- How do downtown vs. suburban tourist areas compare in sentiment trends?  
- Do frequent reviewers leave more positive or negative sentiment?  
- What restaurant themes drive higher satisfaction?  
- What are the most common complaints in negative reviews, and how can an investor avoid them?  

## 🛠 Methodology  
1. **Data Collection** – Scraping or obtaining Yelp review data for selected cities.  
2. **Sentiment Analysis** – Using NLP techniques to analyze review sentiments.

## 📈 Expected Outcomes
